Goal of this github is to showcase my learnings as well as maintain consistency on building new applications.

Current Interests are
- Google Cloud, AWS, and Other Cloud Technologies
- Android Development
- Upskilling in DSA and System Design

Current Courses:
- [Build & Deploy a Production-Ready Patient Management System with Microservices: Java Spring Boot AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tseqdcFfTUY&t=36103s)
  - Need to upskill in integration testing with cloud tools. Instead of doing infrastructure as code in Java, I will utilize Terraform.
